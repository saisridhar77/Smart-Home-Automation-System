# Smart Home Automation System (in progress)

## Project Overview
This project is a **Smart Home Automation System** that allows users to remotely control and monitor home devices such as lights, fans, air conditioning, and security systems. The system provides functionalities like turning devices ON/OFF, adjusting settings (e.g., brightness, temperature), scheduling automation, real-time monitoring, and energy consumption tracking.

The project is implemented in **Java** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and ensures **secure communication and data handling**. It includes user authentication with role-based access control (**Admin vs. Regular User**) and supports **event-driven automation**, such as activating lights when motion is detected.

## Features
1. **Device Control & Monitoring**
   - Remotely turn devices ON/OFF
   - Adjust device settings (e.g., temperature, brightness)
   - Real-time monitoring of device status and energy consumption
2. **User Authentication & Role-Based Access**
   - Secure authentication system
   - Admin and Regular User roles
3. **Automation & Scheduling**
   - Event-driven automation (e.g., motion-based lighting)
   - Schedule devices to turn ON/OFF automatically
4. **Security & Exception Handling**
   - Secure data transmission
   - Error handling for invalid inputs and unauthorized access
5. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - User-friendly interface for interaction

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Implementation
- **Minimum 6 Classes** to encapsulate the system components
- **Method Overloading** (at least 2 cases)
- **Constructor Overloading** (at least 2 cases)
- **Vararg Overloading** (at least 2 cases)
- **Nested Classes** (at least 1 static or non-static)
- **Abstract Class** (at least 1)
- **Interface** (at least 1, supporting single-level or multiple inheritance)
- **Hierarchical Inheritance** (at least 1 instance)
- **Multiple Inheritance** (at least 1 instance)
- **Wrappers** to utilize primitive data types efficiently
- **Package** for better modularization

## Exception Handling
- Handles at least two cases of runtime errors
- Ensures stability during invalid user inputs or system failures

## File Handling & I/O Operations
- Uses **File Handling** for data storage
- Implements **Scanner Class** for user input processing

## Multithreading
- Implements **Runnable Interface** or extends **Thread Class** to handle concurrent operations

## UML Diagram
- The **UML Diagram** is included in the submission folder
- It illustrates the class structure, relationships, and interactions in the system

## Submission Folder Contents
1. **Word Document**
   - Project explanation
   - UML Diagram
   - Java Code appended
2. **UML Diagram** (separate file)
3. **.java Source Files** (all classes and interfaces)
4. **Presentation (PPT)**
5. **Rubrics Table**
   - Lists all the required components (**I to XIII**) and their usage

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Compile the Java Files**
   ```bash
   javac -d . *.java
   ```
3. **Run the Main Class**
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
4. **Interact with the GUI or Command-line Interface**

## Notes
- The code follows best practices for **readability, indentation, and modularity**
- Ensure **Java 8 or later** is installed to run the project
- Non-plagiarized, original implementation
